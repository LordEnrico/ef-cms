Notes
1. Should we allow the same attachment to be added multiple times in the same message?
    - Answer: No, we should gray out the previously selected message ( make it non-selectable)
2. Should we set the modal values in state by default? (we may have control on typing the state values and removing the need for an action to set items in state)
   1. See  `web-client/src/presenter/actions/WorkItem/setCreateMessageModalDialogModalStateAction.ts``
