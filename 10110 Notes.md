# to do:
1. `correspondenceJourney.test.ts`
2. discuss `messageModalHelper.ts` and documentId
3. 9998 manual testing

# Unit tests to update:
    - messageModalHelper.ts
      - why is it "documentId" some times and "docketEntryId" other times? the latter seems to be the real usage, but the former is all over the unit test.
