# to do:
1. Should we set the modal values in state by default? (we may have control on typing the state values and removing the need for an action to set items in state)
   1. See  `web-client/src/presenter/actions/WorkItem/setCreateMessageModalDialogModalStateAction.ts`
2. 9998 manual testing

# Unit tests to update:
    - messageModalHelper.ts
      - why is it "documentId" some times and "docketEntryId" other times? the latter seems to be the real usage, but the former is all over the unit test.


# Questions for UX/Tenille:
  - When there are multiple attachments and the first one is removed, should the subject line update to the new first one?
  - Layout tweaking
  - what is corespondence?
