UX 
- [ ] Add underlines under each accordion item in "Other Ways to File a Case"
- [ ] Correct font-family for dashboard error banner title 
- [ ] Resolve 'Calculate Penalties on IRS Notice' link jumping when clicked. Check for design task

Engineering bug
- [ ] Files uploaded in step 2 clear out if you navigate back to step 2
    - Check validation logic to make sure ATPs documents are not required for creating electronic petitions. (currently does not get past review page)
- [ ] small nit pick, how do we find a location to import event codes i.e `ATP_EVENT_CODE` in `petitionQcHelper.ts`
- [ ] Add pdf validation icons for uploaded ATPs in `Tabs`
- [ ] How does validating that IRS was served when there are already ATP docs?
    - How can we confirm email was sent 'locally'? So far, I'm validating the logs in web api to see that destinations was populated
- [ ] (Nechama) Clean up Multi Select File Input component
- [ ] write smoketests to anaylize the impact of 'processing' ATP when serving cases



PO Questions
- [ ] When QCing an electronic petition, should the "IRS Notice Provided?" option default to the selection the petitioner made when creating it? Check in `Test`
