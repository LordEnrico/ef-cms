- [ ] Add pdf validation icons for uploaded ATPs in `Tabs`
- [ ] How does validating that IRS was served when there are already ATP docs?
    - How can we confirm email was sent 'locally'? So far, I'm validating the logs in web api to see that destinations was populated
- [ ] (Nechama) Clean up Multi Select File Input component
- [ ] write smoketests to anaylize the impact of 'processing' ATP when serving cases
