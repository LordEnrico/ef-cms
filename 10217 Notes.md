- [x] Confirm ATPs are part of attachment (when serving)
    - Multiple ATPs on Attachments Card. (gotoReviewSavedPetitionSequence)
    - Need to change paper filing ATP (single ATP to still be an array of a single ATP, not checking for file name)
        - I don't think it matters because in `serveCaseDocument`, we fetch all the documents based on selected `initialDocumentType`
- [ ] How does validating that IRS was served when there are already ATP docs?
    - [ ] How can we confirm email was sent 'locally'? So far, I'm validating the logs in web api to see that destinations was populated

UX 
- [ ] Add underlines under each accordion item in "Other Ways to File a Case"
- [ ] Correct font-family for dashboard error banner title 
- [ ] Resolve 'Calculate Penalties on IRS Notice' link jumping when clicked. Check for design task
- [x] Remove Service card from Review page
- [x] Update "A Few Reminders to Submit" box on review page

Engineering bug
- [x] Files uploaded in step 2 clear out if you navigate back to step 2 - FIXED
- [ ] Check validation logic to make sure ATPs documents are not required for creating electronic petitions. (currently does not get past review page)
- [ ] small nit pick, how do we find a location to import event codes i.e `ATP_EVENT_CODE` in `petitionQcHelper.ts`
- [ ] Add pdf validation icons for uploaded ATPs in `Tabs`
- [ ] what validation sequence should be run on file upload?

PO Questions
- [ ] When QCing an electronic petition, should the "IRS Notice Provided?" option default to the selection the petitioner made when creating it?
