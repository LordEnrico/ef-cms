::: STUFF TO DO :::
- Manually test accounts with different casing for login on a deployed environment.
- Communicate to Chris + Tenille + team that we improved speed of certain portions of the petitioner/practitioner update. Other flows are still slow but could be updated if it goes well.
- Load test the worker with a petitioner/practitioner that is associated with many cases on the test environment.
- Run identical workflow as prod on another environment.
- Keep on top of our PR to make sure it is up to date to reduce integration errors with the repo. Advocate for deploying this separately.
